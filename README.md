# Chicago-Crime-Dashboard
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>By using Powerbi, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Chicago Crime from 2012 to 2017 based on the Kaggle datasets. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the crime rate in Chicago over the past 5 years. Furthermore, this dashboard also allows for detailed comparisons between the various types of crimes and how they have evolved over time. The data visualization provides invaluable insights that can be used to identify key areas where further action is needed.</h3>

<h3>In the Powerbi dashboard, the first page of the dashboard displayed the Chicago crime dashboard. I used pie chart to show the Primary type with respect to date. After that in cluster column chart I check the Sum of Community Area by Year. Now after that in the same page of dashboard I have checked the primary time in map with the help of latitude and longitude nad at the end i used kpi, card and slicer to get the details of primary type.</h3>
